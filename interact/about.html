                interact-ms was developed at the Quantitative and Systems Biology group at the Max Planck
                Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences. We are particulary interested in finding
                non-canonical peptides in large search spaces. In particular, we are focussed on the
                identification and characterization of proteasomse catalyzed
                peptide splicing both in immunopeptidomics data (<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaf4384">1</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471490617301497?via%3Dihub">2</a>,
                    <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerimmunolres/article/7/1/62/466741/Mapping-the-MHC-Class-I-Spliced-Immunopeptidome-of">3</a>)
                and in <i>in vitro</i> assays (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02572/full">4</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0487-6">5</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01890-6">6</a>).
                The challenges posed by these large search spaces (<a href="https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmic.202100226">7</a>,
                    <a href="https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmic.202200271">8</a>)
                necessitated improvements in peptide identification.
                <br><br>
                In order to leverage the advances made by Prosit (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0426-7">9</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23713-9">10</a>) and NetMHCpan
                (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/W1/W449/5837056?login=true">11</a>)
                we developed <b>inSPIRE</b> (<a href="https://www.mcponline.org/article/S1535-9476(22)00240-7/fulltext">12</a>) as a flexible tool for enhanced peptide identification leveraging these tools.
                It quickly became apparent that inSPIRE had benefits in many applications beyond
                non-canonical peptide identification.
                <br></br>
                One of the most important applications of mass spectrometry on immunopeptidomics is the
                identifications of epitope candidates as potential targets for vaccine development. To
                this end, we developed <b>PEPSeek</b>, a tool which selects candidate peptides from 
                immunopeptidomics datasets. PEPSeek filters for peptides detected in control data and
                pathogen peptides which multi-map to the host proteome. Furthermore, PEPSeek enables
                quantitative analysis of control and infected immunopeptidomes with the use of Skyline
                (<a href="https://www.mcponline.org/article/S1535-9476(20)30461-8/fulltext">13</a>).
                <br><br>
                We provide this interact-ms platform to allow easy access web-server based access for
                any user. A single installation of interact-ms makes our tools available for a whole lab
                so that even users with no computational experience can apply our tools to gain insight
                into their data.
                <br><br>
                We look forward to further developing our software suite in the future.

                Outside of the primary developers, <b>interact-ms</b>, <b>inSPIRE</b> and <b>PEPSeek</b> have benefited from input from within the Quantitative and Systems Biology group
                and our collaborators.
