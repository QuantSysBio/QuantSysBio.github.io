                    I've started the inSPIRE pipeline. Do I need to leave my laptop running?
                </b>
                <br></br>
                If you installed inSPIRE locally and are running inSPIRE-Interactive in local mode,
                you will need to leave the laptop running. However, if inSPIRE is running on a shared
                server and you are accessing the server remotely, nothing is running locally. You
                can safely close your laptop and retrieve results later.
                <br></br>
                <b>
                    What are the requirements for my user and project names?
                </b>
                <br></br>
                The names selected here simply help to divide up the inSPIRE outputs in a sensible
                folder system. However, we strongly discourage the use of white space in your titles,
                for example a username of "john.doe" is much better than "john doe".
                <br></br>
                <b>
                    I closed my browser by accident, how can I get back?
                </b>
                <br></br>
                If you had executed the pipeline and just need to retrieve the results go to the
                start page and select the Retrieve Results workflow. If you had not executed the
                job just select Run inSPIRE workflow and click the proceed button to get back to
                where you were working.
                <br></br>
                <b>
                    My upload seems to be frozen and I don't see any change in the screen.
                </b>
                <br></br>
                If you are uploaded from a remote drive (particularly on Windows systems) there's a
                chance that a network firewall may block the upload. You could try moving the files
                locally and upload from there. To get more details on the problem you can also right
                click on the page and select Inspect.
